# Dual Axis Solar Tracker

Hello everyone, this was my Sophomore design project for the "Design and Analysis of Electromechanical Systems" class. In this project I was responsible for the design
and implementation of the computer/software subsystem for the solar tracker. This file will contain information about the Arduino UNO board and description
of the project, wiring diagrams and flowcharts to visualize the algorithms used for the dual axis solar tracking and the real time power calculations.

The software was developed using the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (Arduino IDE) using the C programming language and an Arduino Uno board, which is
an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc. Moreover, The Arduino Uno has
2 microcontroller units (MCU’s): ATmega328P and ATmega16U2. Both of which are created by Atmel, which was acquired by Microchip Technology in 2016.
The ATmega328P is the main microcontroller on the UNO board. It is an 8-bit microcontroller based on AVR Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture.
On the other hand, the ATmega16U2 chip acts as a bridge between the computer's USB port and the main processor's serial port.
In other words, The ATmega16U2 is programmed to act like a USB-serial adapter in order to make serial communication possible between the main MCU and the computer.

This was a brief summary on the hardware and the software used in this project. Now, let’s start addressing the project itself.

Parts needed: SG90 servos (2), LCD-016M002B (1), Arduino Uno (1), Photo Resistors (4), Solar Panel P105 (1), Push Buttons (6).
